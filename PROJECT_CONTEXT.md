# Project Context: Smart Shopping List App (Proof of Concept)

## 1. Project Vision (The "Why")
The ultimate goal is to develop a mobile application that enhances the in-store grocery shopping experience. The core concept involves a user creating a shopping list on their phone, going to the store, and using their phone's camera to scan items, which then get marked off their list.

## 2. Current Phase: Data Foundation (The "What")
This initial phase is a Proof of Concept focused entirely on acquiring the necessary data to power the app by creating a sample product database.

## 3. Methodology & Technical Plan (The "How")
We are building this database by scraping product information from the Giant Food public website.

### Current Implementation Status ✅
- **Web Scraping Infrastructure**: Complete Python-based scraping system
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of anti-bot measures (403 errors)
- **Demo System**: Working demonstration with realistic mock data
- **Data Output**: CSV and JSON formats for flexible data usage
- **Development Environment**: Full VS Code integration with debugging

### Technical Architecture

#### Core Components
1. **Main Scraper (`main_scraper.py`)**
   - Production-ready scraper with comprehensive error handling
   - Multiple retry strategies for network failures
   - Browser mimicking with realistic headers
   - Flexible CSS selector strategies for HTML parsing

2. **Demo Scraper (`demo_scraper.py`)**
   - Educational demonstration of expected functionality
   - Realistic mock data generation
   - Data analysis and statistics
   - Multiple output formats (CSV/JSON)

3. **VS Code Integration**
   - Automated tasks for running scrapers
   - Python debugging configuration
   - Virtual environment management

#### Web Scraping Strategy
**Target Selectors** (from Giant Food website analysis):
- Product containers: `a.pdl-static-category_product`
- Product names: `h2.pdl-static-category_product_name`
- Product sizes: `p.pdl-static-category_product_unit`
- Fallback selectors for different page structures

**Anti-Bot Mitigation**:
- Comprehensive browser headers (Chrome 120 simulation)
- Request delays and retry logic
- Session management for efficient connections
- Graceful degradation when blocked

#### Data Structure
```csv
name,size,price,url,category,brand
"Lay's Classic Potato Chips","10.5 oz","$3.99","https://giantfood.com/products/lays-classic","Potato Chips","Lay's"
```

#### Current Limitations & Solutions
- **403 Forbidden Errors**: Giant Food implements anti-bot measures
- **Solution**: Demo scraper provides realistic data structure
- **Alternative**: Could implement Selenium for JavaScript rendering
- **Best Practice**: Always respect robots.txt and Terms of Service

### Next Steps (Future Development)
1. **Database Integration**: SQLite or PostgreSQL for structured storage
2. **API Development**: REST API for mobile app integration
3. **Image Processing**: Product image collection and processing
4. **Mobile App**: React Native or Flutter implementation
5. **Barcode Integration**: UPC/EAN code mapping for scanning functionality

### Technical Requirements Met
- ✅ Python virtual environment with isolated dependencies
- ✅ Modular code structure with proper error handling
- ✅ CSV output compatible with Excel and data analysis tools
- ✅ JSON output for API integration
- ✅ VS Code development environment with debugging
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation and README
- ✅ Ethical scraping practices with rate limiting

### Development Notes
- **Language**: Python 3.12+ with modern libraries
- **Dependencies**: requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml
- **Output**: `data/` directory with timestamped files
- **Testing**: Demo mode provides immediate functionality verification
- **Scalability**: Session-based design ready for multi-category scraping
- **Step 2: Barcode (UPC) Acquisition (Future Step)**: Find corresponding UPC barcodes for the scraped products.
- **Step 3: Database Creation (Future Step)**: Combine scraped info and UPCs into a final, clean database.

## 4. Key Technical Discoveries
- **Scraping Target URL Structure:** `https://giantfood.com/groceries/CATEGORY/SUBCATEGORY.html`
- **Confirmed HTML Selectors:**
    - **Main Product Container:** An `<a>` tag with the class `pdl-static-category_product`.
    - **Product Name:** An `<h2>` tag with the class `pdl-static-category_product_name`.
    - **Product Size/Unit:** A `<p>` tag with the class `pdl-static-category_product_unit`.
